## About this soundfont

The SMB Kontakt U78 Grand Piano is sampled from the well-known GP Samples Yamaha CFX-7 (Envy Piano II). This soundfont is specifically optimized and equalized to be used for Black MIDI playback, but can also work well on other cases (such as live piano playback or piano transcriptions). The soundfont consists of 88 lossless WAV samples, for the best sound quality possible. There are a total of 128 default dynamic velocity layers for realism, as well as a preset pack with 128 velocity layers. You can edit this SoundFont on "NotePad" or "Sublime Text", so you can find exactly the sound you are looking for! There are also some interesting addon packs. One of them is a selection of string samples mixed with the piano to give it a “dreamy” or “fantasy” feel, while the other one uses the samples from the infamous Envy Piano II soundfont, as well as its fantasy sound pack.
